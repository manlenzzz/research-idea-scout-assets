## ✨ What is IdeaScout?

**IdeaScout is a profile-guided toolkit for discovering transferable research ideas from large paper collections.**

Instead of only finding papers that are already close to your topic, IdeaScout helps answer a more useful research question:

> **Can the core idea of this paper transfer to my own research problem?**

Users define a **research profile** that describes their target tasks, preferred mechanisms, negative filters, and scoring criteria. IdeaScout then filters candidate papers, asks an LLM to infer each paper's core idea, scores transferability, and provides ranked outputs through both command-line tools and a lightweight web portal.

IdeaScout is designed for researchers who want to mine ideas from **other fields**, not only from papers that share the same task keywords.

---

## 🎯 Why IdeaScout?

Traditional paper search is often topic-driven. It finds papers that are similar to a query, but it may miss papers whose **mechanisms** are useful across domains.

IdeaScout is useful when you want to:

- 🔍 discover **cross-domain transferable ideas**;
- 🧠 search for **mechanisms**, not just topics;
- ⚙️ customize screening for **your own research profile**;
- 📊 rank papers by **transferability, novelty, and feasibility**;
- 🔁 run large LLM-based scoring jobs with **resume** and **auto-retry**;
- 🌐 browse scored papers through a lightweight **web portal**.

## 🏗️ Pipeline Overview

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/pipeline_overview.png" alt="IdeaScout pipeline overview" width="95%">
</div>

IdeaScout separates idea discovery into two stages:

1. **Rule-based candidate filtering**  
   A fast stage that selects candidate papers using profile keywords, preferred mechanisms, and negative filters.

2. **LLM-based idea scoring**  
   A semantic stage where an LLM reads each candidate paper's title and abstract, infers the core idea, identifies the transferable mechanism, and scores the paper against the user's profile.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/research-idea-scout.git
cd research-idea-scout

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to use Codex-based scoring, make sure the Codex CLI is available:

```bash
codex login --device-auth
printf 'Reply only OK\n' | codex exec -
```

Expected output:

```text

```

---

## 📝 Input Format

IdeaScout expects a JSONL file where each line is one paper.

Minimum fields:

```json
{
  "title": "A paper title",
  "abstract": "The paper abstract.",
  "venue": "ICLR",
  "year": 2025,
  "url": "https://example.com/paper"
}
```

Example:

```json
{"title":"Representation Surgery for Concept Editing","abstract":"We propose a method for identifying and editing concept directions in neural representations...","venue":"ICLR","year":2025,"url":"https://example.com/paper1"}
{"title":"Temporal Style Transfer for Motion Generation","abstract":"This paper introduces a temporal style factorization method for controllable motion generation...","venue":"CVPR","year":2026,"url":"https://example.com/paper2"}
```

---

## ⚙️ Step 1: Create Your Research Profile

Copy the template:

```bash
cp configs/profile_template.yaml configs/my_profile.yaml
```

Edit `configs/my_profile.yaml`.

Example:

```yaml
project_name: My Research Project

description: >
  I want to discover transferable ideas from cross-domain machine learning papers
  that may help my own research problem.

target_tasks:
  - name: Main task
    description: >
      Describe your core research problem here.

preferred_mechanisms:
  - latent representation editing
  - modular adapters
  - cross-modal alignment
  - controllable generation
  - concept erasure
  - temporal modeling

positive_keywords:
  - representation editing
  - disentanglement
  - subspace
  - latent direction
  - retrieval augmentation
  - routing
  - controllable generation

negative_keywords:
  - survey
  - benchmark only
  - dataset only
  - leaderboard
  - pure application

scoring_dimensions:
  - key: transferability_to_my_task
    name: Transferability to my task
    description: Whether the paper's core idea can be adapted to my research task.
    weight: 2.0

  - key: method_novelty
    name: Method novelty
    description: Whether the paper contains a genuinely interesting method or theory idea.
    weight: 1.2

  - key: implementation_feasibility
    name: Implementation feasibility
    description: Whether the idea looks practical enough to implement or test.
    weight: 1.0
```

The profile is the main control interface. A precise profile gives more useful rankings.

---

## 🔎 Step 2: Filter Candidate Papers

Run rule-based filtering:

```bash
python scripts/filter_candidates.py \
  --input examples/example_input.jsonl \
  --profile configs/my_profile.yaml \
  --output-keep data/candidates.jsonl \
  --output-reject data/rejected.jsonl \
  --output-summary reports/filter_summary.json \
  --target-total 2000 \
  --min-score 1.0
```

This produces:

```text
data/candidates.jsonl
data/rejected.jsonl
reports/filter_summary.json
```

The filtering step is fast and does not call an LLM.

---

## 🤖 Step 3: Score Papers with Codex

Before running a large job, test one paper first:

```bash
python -u scripts/score_with_codex.py \
  --input data/candidates.jsonl \
  --profile configs/my_profile.yaml \
  --output data/test_scores.jsonl \
  --failures-output data/test_failures.jsonl \
  --top-k 1 \
  --max-new-items 1 \
  --codex-cmd "codex exec"
```

If the test works, run the full scoring job:

```bash
nohup python -u scripts/run_autoretry.py \
  --input data/candidates.jsonl \
  --profile configs/my_profile.yaml \
  --output data/idea_scores.jsonl \
  --failures-output data/idea_score_failures.jsonl \
  --top-k 2000 \
  --codex-cmd "codex exec" \
  --batch-size 1 \
  --sleep-between-rounds 2 \
  --sleep-on-quota 3600 \
  --sleep-on-error 600 \
  --timeout 900 \
  > logs/run_idea_scores_$(date +%F-%H%M%S).out 2>&1 &
```

---

## 📊 Step 4: Check Progress

```bash
python scripts/check_progress.py \
  --output data/idea_scores.jsonl \
  --target-total 2000
```

Or monitor continuously:

```bash
watch -n 30 'python scripts/check_progress.py --output data/idea_scores.jsonl --target-total 2000'
```

To inspect the latest log:

```bash
tail -f $(ls -t logs/run_idea_scores_*.out | head -1)
```

---

## 🏆 Step 5: Export Top-Ranked Papers

```bash
python scripts/export_rankings.py \
  --input data/idea_scores.jsonl \
  --output data/top100_ideas.csv \
  --top-k 100
```

This gives a ranked CSV file that can be opened in Excel, Numbers, LibreOffice, or any spreadsheet viewer.

---

## 📤 Output Format

Each scored paper contains the original metadata plus compact LLM-generated fields.

Example:

```json
{
  "title": "Representation Surgery for Concept Editing",
  "venue": "ICLR",
  "year": 2025,
  "is_suitable": true,
  "priority": "keep",
  "idea_core": "The paper identifies editable concept directions in neural representations.",
  "transferable_mechanism": "Subspace intervention can be reused for controlled representation editing.",
  "fit_reason": "The mechanism aligns well with the user-defined profile.",
  "risk_or_limitation": "The abstract does not show whether all constraints are preserved.",
  "score_overall_fit": 8.0,
  "score_theory_novelty": 7.0,
  "scores": {
    "transferability_to_my_task": 8.0,
    "method_novelty": 7.0,
    "implementation_feasibility": 6.0
  },
  "rank_score": 7.55
}
```

---

## 🌐 Web Portal

IdeaScout includes a lightweight FastAPI web portal for browsing scored papers.

The portal provides:

- a dashboard with corpus-level statistics;
- an article library with search, filtering, and sorting;
- article detail pages with core ideas, transferable mechanisms, risks, and score cards.

### Dashboard

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/portal_home.png" alt="IdeaScout portal dashboard" width="95%">
</div>

### Article Library

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/portal_article_library.png" alt="IdeaScout article library" width="95%">
</div>

### Article Detail

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/portal_article_detail.png" alt="IdeaScout article detail page" width="95%">
</div>

---

## 🖥️ Run the Web Portal

First, import an IdeaScout JSONL output file into the portal database:

```bash
python web/import_jsonl.py \
  --input data/idea_scores.jsonl \
  --db web/ideascout_portal.db
```

Then start the web server:

```bash
python -m uvicorn web.app.main:app \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8080
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

If you are running the portal on a remote server, use SSH port forwarding:

```bash
ssh -N -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 user@server
```

Then open the same local URL in your browser:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

---

## 🧪 Example Profiles

IdeaScout includes example profiles for different research directions.

### 🎙️ Speech Privacy and Accent Conversion

```text
configs/profile_speechprivacy_accent_example.yaml
```

This profile looks for ideas related to:

- multi-attribute speech disentanglement;
- selective attribute obfuscation;
- accent conversion;
- representation editing;
- leakage control;
- privacy-utility evaluation.

### 🖼️ Computer Vision Domain Adaptation

```text
configs/profile_cv_domain_adaptation_example.yaml
```

This profile looks for ideas related to:

- domain generalization;
- distribution shift;
- test-time adaptation;
- robust representations;
- feature alignment.

These are examples only. The intended use is that each researcher creates their own profile.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Codex token invalidated

If you see errors like:

```text
401 Unauthorized
token_invalidated
refresh_token_invalidated
Your session has ended
```

Run:

```bash
codex logout || true
codex login --device-auth
printf 'Reply only OK\n' | codex exec -
```

Then restart the same scoring command. IdeaScout will resume from the existing output file.

---

### Quota or usage limit

If Codex hits a usage limit, the auto-retry runner will sleep and try again later.

Typical log message:

```text
[SLEEP_QUOTA] sleeping 3600s
```

Already processed papers are written to disk immediately, so progress is not lost.

---

### No visible log output

Use unbuffered Python:

```bash
python -u scripts/run_autoretry.py ...
```

For background jobs:

```bash
nohup python -u scripts/run_autoretry.py ... > logs/run.out 2>&1 &
```

---

### Check whether the job is still running

```bash
ps -ef | grep -E 'run_autoretry|score_with_codex|codex exec' | grep -v grep
```

---

## 🧭 Recommended Workflow

A practical workflow for large paper collections is:

1. Collect papers from conference websites, OpenReview, DBLP, Semantic Scholar, or other sources.
2. Convert them into a JSONL file with title and abstract.
3. Write a research profile for your own task.
4. Run rule-based filtering to keep 1k--5k candidates.
5. Run LLM-based idea scoring.
6. Export the top 50--200 papers.
7. Browse the results in the web portal.
8. Read only the most promising papers in depth.
9. Use high-ranked ideas to design new methods or experiments.
